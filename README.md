# ASE_pipeline

This pipeline is built as part of the ASAP project to take single nuclei data and a phased vcf file and, using that data, get allele specific expression information for the single nuclei data using STARSolo. It requires Java, nextflow, and Conda. Detailed running instructions will be added soon.
